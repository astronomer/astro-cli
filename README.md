### Latest version

#### Mac

```sh
brew install astro
```
#### Windows

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-cli/releases)  of the Astro CLI GitHub repository, scroll to a CLI version, and then download the `.exe` file that matches the CPU architecture of your machine.

    For example, to install v1.0.0 of the Astro CLI on a Windows machine with an AMD 64 architecture, download astro_1.0.0-converged_windows_amd64.exe.

2. Rename the file `astro.exe`.

3. Add the filepath for the directory containing the new `astro.exe` as a PATH environment variable. For example, if `astro.exe` is stored in `C:\Users\username\astro.exe`, you add `C:\Users\username` as your PATH environment variable. To learn more about configuring the PATH environment variable, see [How do I set or change the PATH system variable?](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html).

4. Restart your machine.

#### Windows with winget

Starting with Astro CLI version 1.6, you can use the Windows Package Manager winget command-line tool to install the Astro CLI.

Open Windows PowerShell as an administrator and then run the following command:

```sh
winget install -e --id Astronomer.Astro
```

#### Linux

```sh
curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s
```

### Specific version

#### Mac

To install a specific version of the Astro CLI, specify the version you want to install at the end of the command:

```sh
brew install astro@<major.minor.patch-version>
```

#### Windows

1. Delete the existing `astro.exe` file on your machine.

2. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-cli/releases)  of the Astro CLI GitHub repository, scroll to a CLI version, and then download the `.exe` file that matches the CPU architecture of your machine.

    For example, to install v1.0.0 of the Astro CLI on a Windows machine with an AMD 64 architecture, download astro_1.0.0-converged_windows_amd64.exe.

3. Rename the file `astro.exe`.

4. Add the filepath for the directory containing the new `astro.exe` as a PATH environment variable. For example, if `astro.exe` is stored in `C:\Users\username\astro.exe`, you add `C:\Users\username` as your PATH environment variable. To learn more about configuring the PATH environment variable, see [How do I set or change the PATH system variable?](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html).

5. Restart your machine.

#### Windows with winget

Starting with Astro CLI version 1.6, you can use the Windows Package Manager winget command-line tool to install a specific version of the Astro CLI.

To install a specific version of the Astro CLI, specify the version you want to install at the end of the command. For example, running the following command in Windows PowerShell as an administrator installs Astro CLI version 1.6:

```sh
winget install -e --id Astronomer.Astro -v 1.6.0
```

#### Linux

To install a specific version of the CLI, specify the version number as a flag at the end of the command. For example, to install v1.1.0 of the CLI, you would run:

```sh
curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s -- v1.1.0
```

> If you receive a `mkdir` error during installation, download and run the [godownloader](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astronomer/astro-cli/main/godownloader.sh) script locally using:
>
>```sh
>$ cat godownloader.sh | bash -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
>```

#### Troubleshoot installation issues

If you encounter issues when installing the Astro CLI:

- Make sure Docker Desktop is installed correctly. See [Install Docker Desktop on Windows]https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).

- Make sure the Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend is installed and configured correctly. See [Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/).

- Enable Hyper-V on the Docker and Linux Containers and run the Astro CLI natively. For additional information, see the [Docker docs troubleshooting guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/troubleshoot/overview/).

## Get started

1. Create a project

    ```
    $ mkdir hello-astro && cd hello-astro
    $ astro dev init
    ```

2. Install the binary and Confirm the install worked:

    ```
    $ ./astro
    ```

    This generates a basic project directory:

    ```
    .
    ├── dags
    │   ├── example_dag_advanced.py
    │   ├── example_dag_basic.py
    ├── tests
    │   ├── dags
    │       ├── test_dag_example.py
    ├── Dockerfile
    ├── include
    ├── packages.txt
    ├── plugins
    └── requirements.txt
    ```

    DAGs can go in the `dags` folder, custom Airflow plugins in `plugins`, python packages needed can go in `requirements.txt`, and OS level packages can go in `packages.txt`.

3. Run `astro dev start` to start a local version of airflow on your machine. This will spin up a few locally running docker containers - one for the airflow scheduler, one for the webserver, and one for postgres.
(Run `astro dev ps` to verify).

## Versions

Astro CLI versions are released regularly and use semantic versioning. Backwards compatibility between versions cannot be guaranteed. Compatibility is only guaranteed between matching **minor** versions of the platform and the Astro CLI. For example, Astro CLI 0.9.0` is guaranteed to be compatible with houston-api v0.9.x, but not houston-api v0.10.x.

Astronomer ships major, minor, and patch releases of the Astro CLI in the following format:

`{MAJOR_RELEASE}.{MINOR_RELEASE}.{PATCH_RELEASE}`

All Astro CLI releases prior to 1.0.0 are considered beta.

## Change Log

Change log between each version can be found on the [releases](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-cli/releases) page

## Debug

The Astro CLI includes a debug flag that allows you to view queries and internal logs. To enable it, you can pass `--verbosity=debug` in your commands, or you can add the following entry to your `~/.astro/config.yaml` file:

```yaml
verbosity: debug
```
Adding this entry to your `~/.astro/config.yaml` file turns on debugging for all requests until you change it to `info`, or you remove it from the file.

## Support

To resolve an issue, Astronomer recommends reviewing the [Astronomer documentation](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/cli/overview) first.

If you're unable to resolve your issue after reviewing the documentation, you can post a question on the [Astronomer web forum](https://forum.astronomer.io) or you can contact [Astronomer support](https://support.astronomer.io).
