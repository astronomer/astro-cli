## Installing `astro`

The Astronomer CLI is an open-source project. Installing it to your machine allows you to easily spin up a local instance of Apache Airflow and allows you to easily deploy code to remote Airflow environments if you are an Astronomer customer.

> **Note:** If you are an Astronomer customer, your CLI version _must_ match the version of Astronomer you are running. If you are using Astronomer Cloud, the latest version should always be correct. If you have a custom Astronomer Enterprise installation, you may be on a different version, which means you may need to ensure that your CLI and platform match up; you can check which version of Astronomer you're running by clicking the user icon in the top right corner of our UI.

### Latest Version

#### Via `Homebrew`

```sh
brew install astronomer/tap/astro
```

#### Via `curl`

> Note: If you are a Mac user on Catalina make sure you are using the latest version of `curl` or you may receive certificate errors.

```
curl -sSL https://install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s
```

### Previous Versions

#### Via `Homebrew`

To install a specific version Astro CLI use @major.minor.patch. For example, to install v0.13.1 run:

```sh
brew install astronomer/tap/astro@0.13.1
```

#### Via `curl`

To install a previous version of Astronomer, you can add the tag at the end of your `curl` command via the following syntax:

```
curl -sSL https://install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s -- [TAGNAME]
```

ie:

```
curl -sSL https://install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s -- v0.7.5
```

> Note: If you get mkdir error during installation please download and run [godownloader](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astronomer/astro-cli/main/godownloader.sh) script locally.

    $ cat godownloader.sh | bash -s -- -b /usr/local/bin

### Installing on Windows

> Note: Make sure you have Windows 10 and Docker installed

1. Download the latest release of the Astro CLI from [this page](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-cli/releases/)
2. Extract the file ending in `windows_386.zip` and copy `astro.exe` somewhere in your `%PATH%`
3. Open cmd or PowerShell console and run the `astro version` command. Your output should look something like this:

   ```
   C:\Windows\system32>astro version
   Astro CLI Version: x.y.z
   Git Commit: 829e4702ca36dd725f1a98d82b6fdf889e5f4dc3
   ```

#### Troubleshooting

1. Make sure you go through instruction to install Docker on windows properly https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
2. Make sure you enabled Hyper-V, it's required for Docker and Linux Containers, also please review this document
   https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/troubleshoot/

## Getting Started

1. Confirm the install worked:

```
$ astro
```

2. Create a project:

```
$ mkdir hello-astro && cd hello-astro
$ astro dev init
```

This will generate a skeleton project directory:

```
.
├── dags
│   ├── example-dag.py
├── Dockerfile
├── include
├── packages.txt
├── plugins
└── requirements.txt
```

DAGs can go in the `dags` folder, custom Airflow plugins in `plugins`, python packages needed can go in `requirements.txt`, and OS level packages can go in `packages.txt`.

1. Start airflow

Run `astro dev start` to start a local version of airflow on your machine. This will spin up a few locally running docker containers - one for the airflow scheduler, one for the webserver, and one for postgres.
(Run `docker ps` to verify)

## Requirements

The CLI interacts with Docker or Podman in order to run `astro dev` commands, and the minimum supported versions for them are as following:

- Docker Engine: 1.13.1
- Podman: 3.1.0

## Help

The CLI includes a help command, descriptions, as well as usage info for subcommands.

To see the help overview:

```
$ astro help
```

Or for subcommands:

```
$ astro dev --help
```

```
$ astro deploy --help
```

## Development

How to get started as a developer:

1. Build:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:astronomer/astro-cli.git
$ cd astro-cli
$ make build
```

1. (Optional) Install to `$GOBIN`:

```
$ make install
```

1. Run:

```
$ astro
```

### Testing Locally

astro-cli is a single component of the much larger Astronomer Enterprise platform. In order to test locally you will need to

1. setup both [houston-api](https://github.com/astronomer/houston-api) and [astro-ui](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-ui).
2. edit your global or project config to enable local development

ex.

```yaml
local:
  enabled: true
  houston: http://localhost:8871/v1
  orbit: http://localhost:5000
```

### Run tests

To run unit-tests you can run:

> Note: Make sure you have running locally houston on http://localhost:8871/v1 it required for running tests

```bash
make test
```

### Generating Mocks

We currently use [mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery) to generate mocks for interfaces.
Installation guide for mockery: https://github.com/vektra/mockery#installation

Steps to regenerate already existing interface mocks:
1. Run `make mock`.

Steps to generate mocks for new interface:
1. Run `mockery --filename=<file_name_where_interface_is_present> --output=<output_dir_to store_mocks> --dir=<directory_where_to_search_for_interface_file> --outpkg=<mock_package_name> --name <name_of_the_interface>` to generate mock for an interface.
2. Add the above command in appropriate target under `mock` rule in `Makefile`.

## Docs

Docs (/docs) are generated using the `github.com/spf13/cobra/doc` pkg. Currently this pkg is broken with go vendoring, the following instructions include a workaround

1. Remove the `/vendor/github.com/spf13/cobra` pkg, forcing Go to search your go path for the package instead
2. `go run gendocs/gendocs.go`
3. restore `/vendor/github.com/spf13/cobra`

## Versions

The Astronomer platform is under very active development. Because of this we cannot make backwards compatibility guarantees between versions.

The astro-cli is following a semantic versioning scheme

`{MAJOR_RELEASE}.{MINOR_RELEASE}.{PATCH_RELEASE}`

with all releases up until 1.0.0 considered beta.

`astro-cli` tightly tracks the platform release versioning, this means that compatibility is only guaranteed between matching **minor** versions of the platform and the astro-cli. ie. astro-cli `v0.9.0` is guaranteed to be compatible with houston-api `v0.9.x` but not houston-api `v0.10.x`

## Debug

`astro-cli` has a debug flag that allows to see queries and different helpful logs that are done internally. You can enable this by passing `--verbosity=debug` to your commands or you can edit your `~/.astro/config.yaml` and add the following to it. This will turn on debug for all requests that are done until it is changed to `info` or removed from config.

```yaml
verbosity: debug
```

## Support

If you need support, start with the [Astronomer documentation](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/).

If you still have questions, you can post on the [Astronomer web forum](https://forum.astronomer.io) or if you are a customer, you can [open a support ticket](https://support.astronomer.io).
