# `astro deploy` and `astro package`

A project here is a directory whose `pyproject.toml` has a `[tool.astro]` table (see the [manifest reference](manifest-reference.md)). This page describes how such a project deploys to an Astro Deployment, and how `astro package` builds the artifact Astro, MWAA or Cloud Composer consumes without shipping it.

Terms used below:

- An **image deploy** ships the project's code and dependencies as a container image. A **dags-only deploy** ships only `dags/` as a tarball and leaves the running image in place. A **both** deploy (the default) does both.
- The **transport** is the set of calls that talk to Astro: create the deploy, push the image to the Deployment's registry, upload the DAG tarball, finalize.
- The **runtime image** is Astronomer's Airflow base image (`astrocrpublic.azurecr.io/runtime`). Building `FROM` it runs its `ONBUILD` steps, which install the project's `requirements.txt` and `packages.txt`.

## What deploys: a `pyproject.toml` project, and nothing else

v2 deploys only projects with a `pyproject.toml`, on Astro and on Astro Private Cloud. Nobody has to move to v2, and Astro CLI 1.x keeps deploying the projects it made, so v2 has no path for the 1.x layout (a `Dockerfile` and `.astro/config.yaml`).

`astro deploy` looks at the working directory. A `pyproject.toml` with a `[tool.astro]` table is deployed, even if the table fails to validate (the deploy then reports the manifest error). A Dockerfile is not evidence of a 1.x project: a project with a manifest may declare one (`[tool.astro] dockerfile`). The check is `HasManifest` in [`internal/project`](../internal/project/project.go), and the routing is in [`cmd/astro/deploy.go`](../cmd/astro/deploy.go).

Anything else is refused before anything is read or contacted:

- **A project in the 1.x layout** (a Dockerfile beside a `.astro` directory, or a `.astro/config.yaml`; `utils.Is1xLayout`): `this project uses the Astro CLI 1.x layout (a Dockerfile and .astro/config.yaml), and Astro CLI v2 deploys only pyproject.toml projects. Convert it with astro init, or deploy it with Astro CLI 1.x`. This holds for every mode, `--dags` and `--image-name` included.
- **No project at all:** `this is not an Astro project directory. Change to an Astro project directory, or run astro init to make this one an Astro project` (in the home directory, only the first sentence and the advice to change directory).

Both are reported under `--output json` as the error object with kind `no_project`, and exit 1.

`--non-dags` is the one mode that is not a project deploy. It ships a separate directory as a non-DAG bundle, which must not be inside any project, so it runs wherever it is asked, before the project decides anything.

The deploy code lives in `internal/platform/astro/deploy` (`manifest.go`, `manifest_image.go`, and the bundle and Remote Execution client paths beside them) and in [`internal/deploy`](../internal/deploy/deploy.go).

### Astro Private Cloud

v2 does not build projects for Astro Private Cloud yet. Support for `pyproject.toml` projects there is planned. Until then, `astro deploy` under an APC context:

- **refuses a deploy that would build the project**, one without `--image-name`: `Astro CLI v2 cannot build and deploy projects to Astro Private Cloud yet: use Astro CLI 1.x for now.` From a `pyproject.toml` project it adds that support is coming, and that `--dags` uploads the project's DAGs and an image built with `astro package` deploys with `--image-name`. Under `--output json` this is a usage error (exit 2);
- **refuses every deploy from a project in the 1.x layout**, `--image-name` and `--dags` included: `… Astro CLI v2 cannot deploy projects to Astro Private Cloud yet. Deploy it with Astro CLI 1.x for now` (kind `no_project`);
- **deploys an image you built**, `--image-name <ref>`, from anywhere else. The image is tagged and pushed to the Deployment's registry (`--remote` points the Deployment at an image already in a registry instead). A Deployment that takes DAG uploads then gets the working directory's `dags/`, when there is one;
- **uploads a `pyproject.toml` project's DAGs**, `--dags`, from the project directory. Outside one it gives the no-project advice.

## 1. Image deploys

The image is built by [`pkg/imagebuild`](../pkg/imagebuild/imagebuild.go), the same builder Docker-mode `astro local start` and `astro package astro` use, so the three produce the same image from the same manifest. `imagebuild.ForManifest` picks the build:

- **Generated (the common case).** A one-line `FROM astrocrpublic.azurecr.io/runtime:<tag>` Dockerfile, plus a `requirements.txt` holding `[project] dependencies` without `apache-airflow`/`apache-airflow-core` (`manifest.WithoutAirflow`) and a `packages.txt` holding `[tool.astro] packages`. The tag is `[tool.astro] runtime` when set, else the series of the Airflow requirement (`runtime:3.3`). When `[project] requires-python` does not admit that build's default Python, the tag is instead the exact build's Python flavor, `runtime:3.3-8-python-3.13`, for the newest Python the build ships that it admits; with no `runtime` set, the build is the catalog's newest of the series. A `requires-python` admitting none of the build's Pythons is refused before the build, and without a readable catalog the default Python is kept (`imagebuild.RuntimeImageForPython`). The Python is `runtimeversions.ProjectPython`'s choice, which a standalone environment of the same manifest runs too (`imagebuild.StandalonePython`) (see [`requires-python`](manifest-reference.md#requires-python)). Deploy builds only Airflow 3 bases from a generated build.
- **Declared Dockerfile.** When `[tool.astro] dockerfile` is set, that file is the build, with the project directory as context. No base is resolved.

Before anything is built, the deploy checks the project:

- the Dockerfile's `FROM` agrees with the Airflow requirement (`scaffold.CheckDockerfileAirflow`);
- the build secrets resolve, and the local files a declared Dockerfile would copy into the image are warned about;
- a `[tool.astro] runtime` build agrees with the requirement, against the runtime catalog.

The pipeline, in order (`DeployManifestImage` in [`manifest_image.go`](../internal/platform/astro/deploy/manifest_image.go)):

1. Check for a running container engine. Without one the deploy stops (see [Without Docker](#5-without-docker)).
2. Log in with the login for the project's host (see [Selecting the Deployment](#3-selecting-the-deployment)).
3. Collect git metadata (see [Command surface](#6-command-surface)).
4. Fetch the Deployment and check it can take this deploy: CI/CD enforcement, DAG deploys enabled for a both deploy, and the runtimes it offers.
5. Check the planned runtime before the build. The planned runtime is `[tool.astro] runtime`, else the base's tag without any `-python-X.Y` (the series, or the exact build a Python flavor names), or for a declared Dockerfile the runtime its final `FROM` names (`airflowrt.ReadDeclaredBase`). An exact version gets the full rules: no downgrade, a version the Deployment offers, and the Airflow 2→3 floor. A series is refused only when it is older than the Deployment's, or the Deployment offers no build of it. A downgrade error names the line to change. This makes a bad pin fail in seconds rather than after a long build.
6. Build for `linux/amd64` and print "Building your project image, this can take a few minutes...".
7. Read `io.astronomer.docker.runtime.version` off the built image and run the runtime rules again on it. The label is the authority, because the requirement states what the project intends and the label states what the image is.
8. Create the deploy, push the image as user `cli` with the session token, upload the DAG tarball for a both deploy, finalize, and wait for health with `--wait`.

**A deploy to Astro requires an Astro Runtime base.** An image without the runtime label is refused, never deployed on the requirement's word:

- `--image-name`: `image "<ref>" is not based on Astro Runtime (the … label is missing); build it FROM the Astro runtime`
- a declared Dockerfile: `the image built from <Dockerfile> is missing the … label, so it is not based on Astro Runtime; build it FROM an Astro Runtime image`

This is the one limit on a declared Dockerfile. It builds and runs locally on any base, but deploys to Astro only on a runtime base.

`--image-name <ref>` deploys a prebuilt local image and skips the build. It is how CI deploys an image `astro package` built (see [The Astro target](#the-astro-target)).

## 2. Dags-only deploys

`astro deploy --dags` tars `<project>/dags`, uploads it to the URL the create-deploy call returns, and finalizes. It reads the Deployment's runtime version and type from the API, not from the manifest, because the DAGs must fit the image already running. That version decides symlink validation (Airflow 3), the monitoring DAG's Airflow major version, and whether files sit under `dags/` or at the bundle root (`--no-dags-base-dir`). It never builds an image and never needs Docker.

## 3. Selecting the Deployment

The manifest's `[tool.astro.deployments.<name>]` links name the Deployments a project ships to (see the [manifest reference](manifest-reference.md#toolastrodeploymentsname)). `astro deploy` ships only to Astro links. A named MWAA, Composer or endpoint link is refused: `link "<name>" is <kind>, and astro deploy ships to Astro Deployments`. Use `astro package` for those platforms.

**Deploy never picks for you.** Shipping code is too consequential to decide from a marker, a pinned selection or an exported variable, so:

- **The argument or `--deployment` names a link or an id.** `astro deploy prod` ships to the `prod` link. A value no link declares is used as a Deployment id, so `astro deploy <id>` (what astronomer/deploy-action runs) keeps working. Naming both with different values is an error. There is no `-d` shorthand for `--deployment`: on this command `-d` means `--dags`.
- **With nothing named, deploy asks.** The prompt (on stderr) is the CLI's numbered picker table of the project's Astro links. `ASTRO_DEPLOYMENT`, then your `astro use` selection, then the `default = true` link preselect the highlighted entry, labelled in its `PRESELECTED BY` column with whichever put it there (`ASTRO_DEPLOYMENT`, `astro use`, `default = true`), and the prompt shows its number (`> [2]`). Enter takes it. None of them can skip the question, and the prompt does not change your `astro use` selection. A project with exactly one link preselects it as its default. An answer is a link name or a number, exactly as listed, names first, so a link called `2` selects itself. Three bad answers give up.
- **A run that cannot be asked fails.** With no terminal or with `--output json`, a deploy that names nothing stops: `a deploy must name the deployment it ships to: astro deploy <name> or --deployment <name>. …`. Under `--output json` it is the error object with kind `input_required` (see [Prompts](architecture.md#prompts)).
- **A project that links nothing** needs a workspace (`--workspace`, else the current context), then runs the workspace flow `astro deployment` commands use: pick a Deployment, or create one (`deployment.GetDeployment`). A run that cannot be asked must pass `--deployment`.
- **A project whose links are all non-Astro** is refused, naming what it declares, rather than offered an unrelated Deployment.

**Workspace.** `--workspace`, else the link's workspace (its own, or the `[tool.astro]` default it inherits), else the current context's. `--workspace-id`, the older spelling, still works and is hidden from help; given with `--workspace`, the two must agree.

**The project's host picks the login.** A project that names an Astro host (`[tool.astro] domain`, else `ASTRO_DOMAIN`) deploys with the login stored for that host, even while the CLI is switched to another one. That login is used for every step: the Deployment lookup, the deploy record, the registry push, the DAG upload, finalize and `--wait`, whether the Deployment was named by link or by id. With no login for that host, the deploy stops before it builds and names `astro login <domain>`. A project that names no host, or names the current one, uses the current context. The unlinked workspace flow lists Deployments with the current context only, so on another host it refuses and asks for `--deployment <id>`. The same login rule is in [workspace-link.md](workspace-link.md#deployment-links).

## 4. `astro package`

`astro package [target]` builds the artifact one Airflow platform consumes. It never ships: it reads the manifest and project files, needs no account and no link, and touches the network only to pull a base image. That makes it the build stage of a CI pipeline. The default target is `astro`.

Each target implements one interface in [`internal/pack`](../internal/pack/pack.go), so adding a platform is adding a file. A target:

- checks the manifest against its platform and **warns** rather than fails where the platform cannot honor part of it (an Airflow pin it does not offer, OS packages, an `include/` folder with files), because the artifact is still valid;
- builds an artifact of a named kind: an `image`, a `tree` (a directory laid out for a bucket sync) or a `bundle`;
- writes it to a predictable place and reports the exact next command to ship it.

| target | kind | status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `astro` | image | built |
| `mwaa` | tree | built |
| `composer` | tree | built |
| `oss` | — | registered; errors `the "oss" package target is registered but not built yet` |

An unknown target lists the known ones.

### The Astro target

The image build from [section 1](#1-image-deploys), without the transport: resolve the base, build `linux/amd64` (`--platform` overrides), read the runtime label, stop. It needs Docker.

- **Tag:** `astro-package/<project name>:<runtime>-<hash>`, plus a moving `astro-package/<project name>:latest`. The 7-character hash covers the base, the platform, the dependencies, the OS packages and a declared Dockerfile's path and contents, so the same inputs give the same tag. `--tag <ref>` replaces the name and writes no `:latest`.
- **`--save <file>.tar`** also runs `docker save`, for uploading the image as a CI artifact.
- **Declared Dockerfile without a runtime label:** the image is still produced, with a warning that `astro deploy` will refuse it.
- **Declared env values** are not in the image. When the manifest declares any, the build warns and lists them: set them on the Deployment.
- **`--build-secret`** works as it does for `astro deploy` (see [`build-secrets`](manifest-reference.md#build-secrets)).

The CI story is two jobs. Package: `astro package --save image.tar` and upload the file (or `--tag <registry>/…` and `docker push`). Deploy: `docker load < image.tar` (or pull), then `astro deploy prod --image-name astro-package/<name>:<tag>`. Package-then-deploy and a direct deploy build the same image from the same code.

### The `mwaa` target

MWAA builds its environment from an S3 prefix, so the target writes a tree to `dist/mwaa` (`--out-dir` overrides; the directory is wiped first):

- `dags/`, copied as-is.
- `requirements.txt`: MWAA's `--constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-<airflow>/constraints-<python>.txt"` line for the matched version, then the dependencies without Airflow. When MWAA does not offer the pinned Airflow, the file carries a commented constraint template and the versions to pick from, with a warning.
- `plugins.zip`, only when `plugins/` holds real files (a lone `.gitkeep` does not count).
- `ENV_SETUP.md`, only when `[tool.astro.env]` declares values: the checklist of what to set on the environment, each marked `(from workspace)`, `(has a default)`, `(optional)` or `(required)`.

The next steps it prints: `aws s3 sync dist/mwaa/ s3://<bucket>/` (the bucket from `[tool.astro.targets.mwaa] bucket`, with or without `s3://`, else a placeholder), then `aws mwaa update-environment` with the new `requirements.txt` object version, and the `plugins.zip` one when plugins ship. `--save <file>.zip` also writes the tree to one zip.

### The `composer` target

Composer reads `dags/` and `plugins/` from its bucket, but takes PyPI packages as an environment setting, so the tree at `dist/composer` makes the two-part hand-off explicit:

- `dags/`, copied as-is.
- `plugins/`, as a folder, only when it holds real files.
- `composer-requirements.txt`: the dependencies without Airflow and with no constraint line, since Composer resolves against its own image. A header comment names the command that reads it.
- `ENV_SETUP.md`, as for MWAA.

The next steps it prints: `gcloud composer environments storage dags import --environment=<env> --location=<region> --source=…/dags` (and `… plugins import` when plugins ship), then `gcloud composer environments update <env> --location=<region> --update-pypi-packages-from-file …/composer-requirements.txt`.

### Pre-flight: `astro local check --target`

`astro local check --target <name>` checks the project against the Airflow a platform actually runs, before an upload. It maps the manifest's Airflow pin to a version the target offers (from [`pkg/platformversions`](../pkg/platformversions)), builds a scratch virtualenv with that Airflow and the project's dependencies, and runs the same DAG checks as a plain `astro local check`: import errors, duplicate DAG ids, slow parses.

- **Targets:** `astro` (the plain check), `mwaa`, `composer`. The flag repeats and takes a comma list.
- **Mapping:** a pin the platform offers resolves to it. A pin it does not offer maps *down* to the closest lower version, with a note naming both, because that is what would run there. A pin below everything it offers is an error.
- **MWAA constraints:** `--target mwaa` also resolves the dependencies with uv against MWAA's published constraints for the matched version. A conflict fails the target with uv's message. When the constraints cannot be fetched, that step is skipped with a note and the DAG checks still stand. Composer has no published constraints, so it has no such step.
- **Python:** MWAA's Airflow 3 runs Python 3.12 and the check provisions it. Composer does not publish its Python, so the check uses the default interpreter and notes the skew.
- **Cache:** scratch environments live under the astro cache directory (`check-venvs/`), keyed by Airflow, Python and the full requirement set. The check prints whether it is reusing one or provisioning one. Unused ones are removed after 14 days.
- **Exit codes:** `0` clean, `1` findings (or an MWAA constraints conflict), `2` an operational problem. With several targets the worst code wins.
- **`--output json`:** one object per target per line: `target`, `airflow_checked`, `mapped_from`, `notes`, `constraints`, `findings`, `dags`, `errors`, `warnings`, `error`.

## 5. Without Docker

An image deploy needs a container engine (the `container.binary` setting picks Docker or Podman). Without one, `astro deploy` stops before any transport work:

```
an image deploy needs Docker, but no running container engine was found. Start Docker and try again, or run 'astro deploy --dags' to deploy just your DAGs (no Docker needed). Server-side builds are coming
```

The check runs for `--image-name` too. A dags-only deploy never needs Docker, and neither do the `mwaa` and `composer` package targets. `astro package astro` refuses the same way. A server-side build, where the CLI uploads the context and the control plane builds, is the long-term answer for users without Docker and is not built.

## 6. Command surface

Both commands follow the CLI's output rules: text by default, `--output json` from the same value (see [Output](architecture.md#output)).

```
astro deploy [LINK-NAME | DEPLOYMENT-ID] [flags]
  --deployment <name|id>  the link name or Deployment id to deploy to
  --workspace <id>        the workspace (overrides the link's and the context's)
  -d, --dags              deploy only dags/ (no image build, no Docker)
  --image                 deploy only the image, leave DAGs untouched
  -i, --image-name <ref>  deploy a prebuilt local image; skips the build
  --no-dags-base-dir      put DAG files at the bundle root rather than under dags/
  --description <text>    description recorded on the deploy
  --build-secret <spec>   a build secret, repeatable (not with --dags or --image-name)
  -w, --wait              wait for the Deployment to report healthy
  --wait-time <dur>       how long --wait waits (default 5m)
  --output text|json

astro package [TARGET] [flags]    # astro (default), mwaa, composer, oss
  --save <file>           also write the artifact to one file (.tar for astro, .zip for a tree)
  --tag <ref>             image reference for the astro target
  --platform <p>          build platform for the astro target (default linux/amd64)
  --out-dir <dir>         tree directory for bucket targets (default dist/<target>)
  --build-secret <spec>   a build secret, repeatable (astro target only)
  -o, --output text|json
```

The flags only a 1.x project's deploy read are gone: `--save` (`-s`), `--pytest`, `--env` (`-e`), `--test` (`-t`), `--parse`, `--deployment-name` (`-n`), `--dags-path` and `--dag-bundle-name`, and on Astro Private Cloud `--save` and `--no-cache`. A run passing one fails as a usage error naming what replaced it (run the tests with `uv run pytest` first, check the DAGs with `astro local check`, name the Deployment with `--deployment`, and so on; see [Removed 1.x commands and flags](architecture.md#removed-1x-commands-and-flags)). `--force` and `--prompt` are accepted and do nothing. `--non-dags` and its `--non-dags-*` flags deploy a non-DAG bundle from a separate directory, and take their Deployment as the argument or `--deployment`.

**Git metadata.** With the `deploy.git_metadata` setting on (the default), the deploy records the HEAD commit on Astro, and the commit message becomes the description when `--description` is not given. `commit_url` is set only for a GitHub remote. A project with uncommitted changes to tracked files records no commit and prints `note: the project has uncommitted changes, so this deploy records no git commit` on stderr. `--image-name` records none.

**`astro deploy --output json`** prints one object when the deploy finishes. It streams no progress events, so the object is a result like any other (see [Output](architecture.md#output)): indented and colored on a terminal, one line when piped. Its shape is pinned by `cmd/astro/testdata/schema/deploy.json`.

```json
{
  "deployment": "clx…",
  "link": "prod",
  "workspace": "clw…",
  "type": "image-and-dag",
  "image_tag": "deploy-2026-07-23T18-40",
  "dag_bundle_version": "3-1690000000",
  "runtime_version": "3.1-2",
  "url": "https://cloud.astronomer.io/…",
  "git": {
    "commit_sha": "0123abc…",
    "branch": "main",
    "commit_url": "https://github.com/…/commit/0123abc…"
  }
}
```

`deployment`, `workspace` and `type` (`dag-only`, `image-only` or `image-and-dag`) are always present. The rest are omitted when they do not apply: a dags-only deploy has no `image_tag`, an image-only deploy no `dag_bundle_version`, a Deployment named by id no `link`, a deploy with no recorded commit no `git`.

**`astro package --output json`** streams the build's log lines as `{"event":"log",…}` objects, then prints one result object:

```json
{
  "target": "astro",
  "kind": "image",
  "image": "astro-package/my-project:3.1-2-a1b2c3d",
  "runtime_version": "3.1-2",
  "saved_path": "image.tar"
}
```

`target` and `kind` are always present. An image carries `image`, `runtime_version` and, with `--save`, `saved_path`. A tree carries `tree_path`, `deps_file` and `next_steps`. A bundle carries `bundle_path`. `size`, when present, is the saved file's size in bytes, and `warnings` lists the target's warnings, including undeclared local env values that will not follow the project.
